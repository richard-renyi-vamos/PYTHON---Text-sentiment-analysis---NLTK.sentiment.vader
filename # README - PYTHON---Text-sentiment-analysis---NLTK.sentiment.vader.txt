Sure, I can provide you with a basic example of a Python code using deep learning to analyze text sentiment and display some statistics in a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. We'll use a pre-trained deep learning model for sentiment analysis. For this example, we'll use the Vader sentiment analysis model, which is commonly used for text sentiment analysis tasks.

First, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install nltk tkinter
Now, here's a basic Python code:

python
Copy code
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

def analyze_sentiment():
    text = text_entry.get("1.0", tk.END)
    analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    sentiment_scores = analyzer.polarity_scores(text)
    display_results(sentiment_scores)

def display_results(scores):
    for key, value in scores.items():
        result_label = tk.Label(result_frame, text=f"{key.capitalize()}: {value}", font=("Helvetica", 12))
        result_label.pack()

# Create main window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Text Sentiment Analyzer")

# Create text entry
text_entry = tk.Text(root, height=10, width=50, wrap=tk.WORD)
text_entry.pack(pady=10)

# Create analyze button
analyze_button = ttk.Button(root, text="Analyze", command=analyze_sentiment)
analyze_button.pack()

# Create frame for results
result_frame = tk.Frame(root)
result_frame.pack(pady=10)

# Run the GUI loop
root.mainloop()
This code creates a simple GUI using Tkinter. It includes a text entry box where you can input the text you want to analyze. When you click the "Analyze" button, the sentiment analysis function is called, which analyzes the text using the Vader sentiment analysis model. The results are then displayed in a separate frame below the button.

Please note that this is a basic example, and you can extend it further by adding more features, such as analyzing more aspects of the text, visualizing the results in different ways, or using more advanced deep learning models for sentiment analysis.
